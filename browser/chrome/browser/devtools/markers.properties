# LOCALIZATION NOTE These strings are used inside the Performance Tools
# which is available from the Web Developer sub-menu -> 'Performance'.
# The correct localization of this file might be to keep it in
# English, or another language commonly spoken among web developers.
# You want to make that choice consistent across the developer tools.
# A good criteria is the language in which you'd find the best
# documentation on web development on the web. These strings
# are specifically for marker names in the performance tool.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (marker.label.*):
# These strings are displayed in the Performance Tool waterfall, identifying markers.
# We want to use the same wording as Google Chrome when appropriate.
